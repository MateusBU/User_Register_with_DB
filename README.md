## Project Overview

This project implements a user registration system using [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful **React framework** developed by **Vercel**. Next.js provides a comprehensive solution for both frontend and backend development, enabling the creation of fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js extends React's capabilities with a rich set of features, including:

* **File-based routing:** Intuitive routing system based on your project's file structure.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG):** Multiple rendering strategies for optimal performance and SEO.
* **API Routes:** Built-in support for creating backend API endpoints directly within your Next.js application.
* **Built-in Routing and Dynamic Routes:** Flexible routing for static and dynamic content.
* **Styling Support:** Native support for CSS Modules, seamless integration with Tailwind CSS, and more.
* **Easy Integration:** Simplified integration with databases, authentication services, and deployment platforms.

## Folder Structure & Routing

Next.js utilizes a **file-based routing system**, where application URLs are automatically generated based on the project's folder and file organization.

### 🆕 App Router (Next.js 13+)

This project leverages the **App Router**, introduced in Next.js 13, which is the recommended approach for structuring new applications. It is organized within the `app/` directory.

Each folder within `app/` defines a **route**, and a `page.jsx` (or `page.tsx`) file inside that folder specifies the content rendered at the corresponding URL.

### 📂 Example Folder Structure:
app/
├── page.jsx          → /
├── about/
│   └── page.jsx      → /about
├── blog/
│   ├── page.jsx      → /blog
│   └── post/
│       └── page.jsx  → /blog/post

### 🌐 Corresponding URLs:

| File/Folder Path         | URL        |
| :----------------------- | :--------- |
| `app/page.jsx`           | `/`        |
| `app/about/page.jsx`     | `/about`   |
| `app/blog/page.jsx`      | `/blog`    |
| `app/blog/post/page.jsx` | `/blog/post` |

This file-based routing system streamlines development and promotes a well-organized project structure.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Commands

This section outlines common Next.js-related commands.

* `npm install`: Installs all project dependencies defined in `package.json`.
* `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
* `npm run build`: Creates an optimized production build of your application. Generate static files.
* `npm run start`: Starts the production server (after building).

### Initializing a Next.js Project:

* **`npm i create-next-app`**
    Installs the `create-next-app` package locally within your project's `node_modules` directory. This is useful if you plan to reuse the package multiple times or integrate it into a scripting workflow.

* **`npx create-next-app user_register`**
    Executes `create-next-app` without permanently installing it globally or locally. This command directly downloads and utilizes the latest version of the package from npm to create a new Next.js project in a folder named `user_register`. This is the recommended approach for starting new Next.js projects.


### Firebase:
* Create a project at Firebase Console.
* Create a Firestore Database. For this project, it was created a DB in `Test Mode`.
